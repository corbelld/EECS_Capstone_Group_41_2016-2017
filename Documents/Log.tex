At the middle school and high school level, students begin taking an interest in their future career paths and for many, it remains unclear how to get started towards their goals and what requirements they need to fulfill. In the case of health and sciences, there exist many branching paths to explore before making a definitive choice: among these paths includes therapeutic services, diagnostics, health informatics, support services, as well as research and development departments, each branching further into more specific fields. Students require knowledge of each field in order to make an educated choice and without an organized platform it may be difficult for students to identify which option is most suited for them.
